# freeCodeCamp
This repository is meant to record my learning progress on freeCodeCamp. Documenting a journey usually provides good insight for later review. I will write about the projects I complete for this course and how I tackle the challenges I face. I'm not a complete beginner, as I have already taken a few courses or watched tutorials related to coding. I plan to finish this entire program within 6 months.

Thank you for checking out this repository. If you are new to my GitHub, be sure to follow me. And if you're here because you've also started your journey on freeCodeCamp, good luck to you!
